## Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive usability evaluation and interface redesign of the Ebenezer Concrete Products website (ebenezerconcreteproducts.com). The goal is to identify usability issues and create an improved, user-centered design that enhances navigation, visual clarity, and overall user experience.

## Identified Usability Problems

1. **Oversized Logo** - Takes excessive vertical space
2. **Poor Contact Info Visibility** - Small, hard to read
3. **Weak Call-to-Action** - No clear user guidance
4. **Text Overload** - Long paragraphs on homepage
5. **Broken Social Media Integration** - Incomplete features
6. **Poor Navigation Hierarchy** - Unclear menu structure
7. **Unclear Search Function** - Unlabeled search icon
8. **Unknown Mobile Responsiveness** - No responsive design

## Redesign Improvements

- ✅ Compact, professional header (70px)
- ✅ Clear visual hierarchy
- ✅ Prominent call-to-action buttons
- ✅ Service cards layout for easy scanning
- ✅ Improved color contrast and readability
- ✅ Modern, clean aesthetic
- ✅ Better spacing and organization

## Evaluation Method

**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:**
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation
